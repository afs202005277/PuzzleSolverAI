Compilation instructions: this project runs in Python3, therefore there is no need to compile the project. However, we use some additional libraries that need to be previously installed in the computer, namely:
- dash and plotly.graph_objs: used to deploy the WEB page that contains the analysis of the algorithms and heuristics 
- pandas: used to handle the information to be used in the graphics
- heapq: used to create a heap that is used by the informed search methods to choose the node to be expanded next in a more efficient way.
- collections:  we use the deque data structure from this library in the algorithms.
- pygame: this library was used to support the Graphical User Interface
